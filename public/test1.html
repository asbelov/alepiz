Some callbacks used by methods exposed by this module provide two instances of the JavaScript Date class specifying when the first ping was sent for a request, and when a request completed.

These parameters are typically named sent and rcvd, and are provided to help round trip time calculation.

A request can complete in one of two ways. In the first, a ping response is received and rcvd - sent will yield the round trip time for the request in milliseconds.

In the second, no ping response is received resulting in a request time out. In this case rcvd - sent will yield the total time spent waiting for each retry to timeout if any. For example, if the retries option to the createSession() method was specified as 2 and timeout as 2000 then rcvd - sent will yield more than 6000 milliseconds.

Although this module provides instances of the Date class to help round trip time calculation the dates and times represented in each instance should not be considered 100% accurate.

Environmental conditions can affect when a date and time is actually calculated, e.g. garbage collection introducing a delay or the receipt of many packets at once. There are also a number of functions through which received packets must pass, which can also introduce a slight variable delay.

Throughout development experience has shown that, in general the smaller the round trip time the less accurate it will be - but the information is still useful nonetheless.

A request can complete in one of two ways. In the first, a ping response is received and rcvd - sent will yield the round trip time for the request in milliseconds.

In the second, no ping response is received resulting in a request time out. In this case rcvd - sent will yield the total time spent waiting for each retry to timeout if any. For example, if the retries option to the createSession() method was specified as 2 and timeout as 2000 then rcvd - sent will yield more than 6000 milliseconds.

Although this module provides instances of the Date class to help round trip time calculation the dates and times represented in each instance should not be considered 100% accurate.

Environmental conditions can affect when a date and time is actually calculated, e.g. garbage collection introducing a delay or the receipt of many packets at once. There are also a number of functions through which received packets must pass, which can also introduce a slight variable delay.

Throughout development experience has shown that, in general the smaller the round trip time the less accurate it will be - but the information is still useful nonetheless.
Some callbacks used by methods exposed by this module provide two instances of the JavaScript Date class specifying when the first ping was sent for a request, and when a request completed.

These parameters are typically named sent and rcvd, and are provided to help round trip time calculation.

Throughout development experience has shown that, in general the smaller the round trip time the less accurate it will be - but the information is still useful nonetheless.
Some callbacks used by methods exposed by this module provide two instances of the JavaScript Date class specifying when the first ping was sent for a request, and when a request completed.

These parameters are typically named sent and rcvd, and are provided to help round trip time calculation.

A request can complete in one of two ways. In the first, a ping response is received and rcvd - sent will yield the round trip time for the request in milliseconds.

In the second, no ping response is received resulting in a request time out. In this case rcvd - sent will yield the total time spent waiting for each retry to timeout if any. For example, if the retries option to the createSession() method was specified as 2 and timeout as 2000 then rcvd - sent will yield more than 6000 milliseconds.

Although this module provides instances of the Date class to help round trip time calculation the dates and times represented in each instance should not be considered 100% accurate.

Environmental conditions can affect when a date and time is actually calculated, e.g. garbage collection introducing a delay or the receipt of many packets at once. There are also a number of functions through which received packets must pass, which can also introduce a slight variable delay.
