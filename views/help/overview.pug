                    h2 Overview of ALEPIZ
                    p.
                        ALEPIZ is designed to organize monitoring and automation of infrastructure processes.
                        Due to the fact that ALEPIZ combines monitoring and automation, it is possible to set up a
                        system where all processes will be logically interconnected based on monitoring data.
                        This approach implies that automation processes will be launched depending on the current state
                        of the infrastructure.
                    p.
                        For example, packing of log files will be automatically started after a complete shutdown of
                        the service according to a schedule based on information received from the monitoring system.
                        The service files will be backed up after the log files packing operation is completed.
                        Automatic update of the service to the new version will be performed immediately after
                        receiving information about the end of the backup process. Until the service update process is
                        completed, the automatic start of the service will not be performed.

                            h3 Key Features
                            blockquote.
                                After installation, ALEPIZ is immediately ready for use. It includes all necessary
                                components, including a Web server and a database server. For its functioning,
                                the system does not require the installation of additional software.
                            blockquote.
                                ALEPIZ can be quickly prepared for use in a small infrastructure by manually creating
                                static monitoring objects without having to deeply study the system and develop
                                your own components.
                            blockquote.
                                With ALEPIZ, you can customize the maintenance of an extensive infrastructure by
                                combining all its parts into a single whole, automating various processes and
                                developing new components for its maintenance.
                            blockquote.
                                ALEPIZ allows you to achieve high performance and serve a large number of processes
                                through the use of parallel computing, an asynchronous system core and components,
                                a productive database, and the use of smart caching.
                            blockquote.
                                ALEPIZ's smart algorithm for skipping similar data allows you to reduce storage
                                requirements by five or more times without sacrificing information content.
                                Due to the fact that some of the similar data is not processed, the load on the
                                computing core of the system is reduced, allowing the use of fewer server resources.
                            blockquote.
                                Access to ALEPIZ, all settings and system management is carried out through the
                                Web interface. The interface automatically adapts to work on desktop PCs, tablets or
                                smartphones, depending on the screen size, resolution and input method

                    h3 Maintenance of non-standard infrastructure
                    p.
                        If the infrastructure being served cannot be managed by standard means, ALEPIZ provides the
                        opportunity to develop new components. Component development tools and documentation for their
                        creation are built into ALEPIZ. Open source existing components can serve as an example.
                    img(src="./images/help.overViewDev.png" width="1024px").materialboxed.card-panel.hoverable
                    h2 Features of the monitoring system
                    p.
                        ALEPIZ has a built-in monitoring system that allows you to collect and store historical data
                        supporting various information collection protocols. Setting up a monitoring system is based on
                        creating dependencies between meters that collect data. For example, it does not
                        collect the application data of a service if it is stopped. Therefore, the counters that
                        collect application information about the service must depend on the counter that collects
                        information about the status of the service. If the status of the service indicates that the
                        service is stopped, the start condition for child application data collection counters will
                        not be met and they will not start. Even data collection, standard for monitoring systems,
                        at time intervals is configured as a dependence on a counter that generates signals at certain
                        time intervals.
                    p.
                        Dependencies between counters are also used to generate events. They can, for example, be
                        configured in such a way that the counter that generates the event is triggered after the
                        received values from the parent counter have exceeded the set threshold. For example, you can
                        set up a dependency so that when the amount of free memory on the server drops to 1Gb, a
                        counter will be launched that generates the corresponding event. A warning will appear on the
                        Dashboard, which, if necessary, will be duplicated by voice. Administrators will be notified by
                        e-mail and/or other means.
                    p.
                        All collected historical data is available for further viewing and analysis. To prevent the
                        database from growing indefinitely, a system for cleaning old historical data is provided.
                        For quick access to a large amount of data, a trend system is used that stores only the
                        arithmetic average of historical data values for certain time intervals.
                    p.
                        System maintenance tasks can be launched based on the analysis of the system state according to
                        the received historical data collected by the built-in monitoring system.
                    p.
                        In the absence of means for collecting data, for example, if the application system returns
                        them in a non-standard way, ALEPIZ allows you to develop and connect a new collector adapted
                        to the application system.
                    h3 Data throttling algorithm
                    p.
                        To reduce the load on the computing core and disk subsystem, ALEPIZ uses an intelligent
                        algorithm to data throttling. When a new value is received, the collected data is automatically
                        analyzed and if the new value does not differ significantly from the data that was received
                        before, it will not be processed by the ALEPIZ computing core and will not be written to the
                        database. For example, the amount of RAM on the server is collected every 30 seconds and
                        usually changes slightly. ALEPIZ will analyze the changes and skip up to six similar values
                        received from the counter. This allows you not to occupy disk space with the same data, while
                        having a complete picture of historical values. If necessary, throttling settings can be reconfigured
                        or disabled for any collector that supports it.

                    h2 ALEPIZ components
                    p.
                        The modular architecture of ALEPIZ consists of a core to which various components are connected.
                        Below is a description of the types of components that can be connected to ALEPIZ. If necessary,
                        you can develop your own components of any type.

                            h4 Collectors
                            p.
                                ALEPIZ allows you to collect and save data from various systems. A collector is used
                                to collect each type of data. For example, ALEPIZ can collect data about hardware
                                operation via SNMP protocol or operation system data and software operation from
                                #[a(href="https://www.zabbix.com" target="__blank") Zabbix agents], check availability
                                and response time of services on the network by connecting to a remote service port
                                via TCP/IP or analyze the response time of hosts using the built-in Ping collector.
                                It is also possible to find new hosts on the network using the Objects discovery
                                collector, automatically generating infrastructure monitoring. You can report events
                                based on collected data threshold violations or, for example, run tasks when certain
                                conditions are met.
                            p.
                                If necessary, you can develop your own collector, which will take into account the
                                architecture of the used system and collect the necessary data from it or generate
                                your own.

                            h4 Actions
                            p.
                                ALEPIZ allows you to perform certain actions. You can perform an internal action, such
                                as creating a new monitoring object in ALEPIZ, or an external one, such as starting a
                                service, or packing log files, or updating a service. In addition, the action can be
                                used to view information, for example, you can view a log file or data collected by
                                the built-in monitoring system. Using the action, you can connect to a remote server
                                using the RDP or ILO protocol.
                            p.
                                You can develop your own actions that will be used in the maintenance of any
                                non-standard infrastructure.

                            h4 Launchers
                            p.
                                To run actions, are used components that allow them to be launched, depending on the
                                architecture chosen for the action. Such components are called launchers.
                                An example of a launcher is a module for connecting and launching a JavaScript file
                                written in nodejs, or launching an external program that will be passed the necessary
                                command line parameters, or executing the program on a remote server via the SSH or
                                WMI protocol.
                            p.
                                If the existing launchers in ALEPIZ are not enough, you can develop a new one yourself.
                            h4 Communication medias
                            p.
                                Communication medias are used to communicate with users. The means of communication can
                                be email, SMS, voice notification, and so on. Actions and collectors can use
                                communication medias to transfer various information to users of the system.
                                For example, it can be events that have occurred in the operation system or a
                                change in the status of a task.
                            p.
                                If the communication medias existing in ALEPIZ is not enough, you can independently
                                develop a new one.

                    div.row
                        div.col.s12.m9
                            p.
                                The ALEPIZ architecture is as simple as possible to understand. It has three built-in
                                entities that perform infrastructure maintenance. These are objects, counters and tasks.
                            h4 Objects
                            p.
                                Objects are any entity that can have a name. An example of an object could be the name
                                of a server from which monitoring data is collected, or a group that contains other
                                objects (for example, object Servers that contains servers of an organization),
                                or a template that stores standard properties for quickly creating new objects.
                            h4 Counters
                            p.
                                Counters are entities that are used to collect or generate data using collectors with
                                certain parameters. For example, the Ping collector needs to pass a hostname as a
                                parameter. For each counter, a collector is selected and the required parameters for
                                data collection are configured. The counter is always connected to one or more objects.
                                For example, a counter that collects the amount of available RAM can be connected to
                                objects responsible for monitoring the organization's servers. Counters can depend on
                                each other. Data is collected only when the necessary conditions are met. For example,
                                it doesn't make sense to collect data about a process's memory consumption until the
                                process is not running. The generation of various monitoring events is also based on
                                counter dependencies.
                            h4 Tasks
                            p.
                                Tasks are actions grouped into a sequence. For example, it can be the creation of a new
                                ALEPIZ object and the connection of counters to it to collect the necessary information.
                                Or update the service files and run the SQL script to modify the database structure.
                                Tasks can be launched in various ways, for example, manually or by some condition, or
                                by creating a special counter for this.

                        In addition to collecting data, you can perform data processing. ALEPIZ contains functions for
                        processing historical data and for creating expressions that process data. If necessary,
                        JavaScript code fragments can be included in the data processing process. The resulting values
                        can be used in both parent and all dependent counters. Collectors and tasks can also receive
                        parameters that are generated dynamically.
