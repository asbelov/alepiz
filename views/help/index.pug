                    p.
                        Access to the ALEPIZ system is provided through the Web interface. The ALEPIZ interface is
                        designed to be used on devices with different screen resolutions and orientations. These can
                        be smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops. Interface adaptation occurs automatically.

                    h3 Actions, Objects and Filters system menu
                    p.
                        The Actions, Objects and Filters system menu is on the left. If it is hidden, it is called by
                        clicking on the #[i.material-icons menu] icon in the upper left corner of the screen.
                        The menu is used to select objects, filter objects, select an action, as well as to search for
                        actions and objects.
                    h3 Actions
                    p.
                        These components allow you to perform actions or provide some information. An example of
                        actions can be creating an object in ALEPIZ, administering users, viewing log files,
                        viewing a graph with historical information collected by the built-in monitoring system
                        (in the screenshot above), restarting a service on a remote server, editing a configuration
                        file, creating tasks that combine other actions for automation etc.
                    p.
                        You can develop your own actions to automate processes.
                    p.
                        Actions can be performed by starting them manually or as part of a task in automatic mode,
                        depending on the events that have occurred. An action can also be performed as part of a task
                        according to a specified schedule.
                    p.
                        The Actions tab (located on the left in the screenshot above) contains actions grouped into
                        groups. When you click on the selected action, it will be shown in the main system window.
                        The screenshot above in the main window shows the interface of the selected Data browser action
                        with the collected monitoring data and a graph.

                    h4 Action Search
                    p.
                        Above the Actions system menu is a search form for actions. If you start typing some part of
                        the name of the action in the form, hints will appear from which you can select the desired
                        action. If no action matches the typed text, ALEPIZ will automatically switch to searching
                        for objects.
                    p.
                        If you click on the #[i.material-icons search] icon next to the search bar, a hint will appear
                        on how to use the search.
                    img(src="./images/help.mainActionSearch.png").materialboxed.card-panel.hoverable

                    h3 Objects
                    p.
                        The Objects tab contains objects. Objects are any entities in the system that can have a name.
                        Each object in the system must have a unique name. Examples of objects might be a host name,
                        a group that includes other objects (for example, a Servers object that includes servers),
                        a program, a service, a template with counters, and so on. You can independently create and
                        delete objects, manage their grouping and filtering.

                    h4 Object navigation
                    p.
                        When you select the "Objects" tab, the name of the "Objects" tab will be changed to "To top".
                        Clicking on "To top" takes you to the top level of objects.
                    p.
                        If you click on the name of an object, a list of nested objects will appear. If there are no
                        nested objects, then the object will be selected. An element of the CheckBox type is used to
                        select an object, which is located to the left of each object.

                    h4 Interactions between objects.
                    p.
                        The configured interactions between objects allow you to filter objects in the Objects system
                        menu. Interactions can be configured using the Objects Interactions action. By selecting two or
                        more objects and clicking on one of them, you can get a list of objects contained in them,
                        which will be generated depending on the configured interaction between objects. This can be
                        all objects included in the selected parent objects. Or it can only be shared objects for the
                        selected parent objects. Or it can only be non-shared objects for the selected parent.
                        A detailed description of interactions and their settings can be found on the help page for
                        the action
                        #[a(href="/actions/objects_interactions/help/") Objects Interactions].

                    h4 Search for objects
                    p.
                        Above the Objects system menu is the object search form. If you start typing some part of the
                        object name in the form, after entering a few characters in the Objects system menu, objects
                        will appear whose names contain the typed text.
                    p.
                        You can use the characters "&" (and) and "|" (or) to combine search queries into a boolean
                        expression. Instead of the symbol "|" line breaks can be used.
                    p.
                        To search for objects, you can use patterns: "_" - any one character and
                        "*" - a sequence of zero or more characters.
                    p.
                        If you want to use the characters "_" or "*" not as wildcards, but as part of object names,
                        they must be escaped with the "\" character.
                    p.
                        If you click on the #[i.material-icons search] icon next to the search bar, a hint will appear
                        on how to use the search.

                    h4 Filters
                    p.
                        The FILTERS menu allows you to set filters for objects. When using filters, objects that do
                        not match the selected filters will not be displayed. The administrator can set up arbitrary
                        filters based on object properties, top-level object properties, and received historical data.
                        The FILTERS menu will not be displayed if the administrator has not configured any filters.
                        Filters are only applied to objects that have properties or counters that match the filters
                        to retrieve historical data. Objects that do not have corresponding properties or counters
                        will be displayed regardless of the filters set. If filters are selected, FILTERS is
                        highlighted in red.
                    img(src="./images/help.mainFilters.png").materialboxed.card-panel.hoverable
                    p.
                        You can select multiple filters and change the logical operator linking the filters together.
                        By default, multiple filters are linked with a logical "AND" operator. In order to change the
                        operator, you need to click on "Change filter expression" under the filters and in the filter
                        editor that appears, click on the operator you want to change.
                        Operators "AND" and "OR" are supported.

                    p.
                        The window is opened when the action starts or when the #[i.material-icons file_upload] icon is
                        clicked, which is located in the upper right corner of the screen. The data is presented as a
                        sequence of records and represents information about an action.
                    p.
                        The information is divided into sections, each of which is responsible for running a specific
                        action. Depending on the debug level configured, the amount of information displayed may vary.
                        Clicking on a section heading will show or hide the contents of the section. The information
                        is updated automatically while the information window is open.

                                It is located at the bottom right of the screen. Depending on the availability of
                                rights to run or save actions, all or only part of the control buttons will appear.
                            h5.

                            p.
                                The clipboard allows you to create an arbitrary list of objects in the Objects system
                                menu, even if such a list cannot be created using the search and grouping of objects.
                                The button allows you to remember the selected objects, and then display them as a list.
                                For example, if you select multiple objects and click on
                                #[a.btn-small.btn-floating.waves-effect.waves-light.blue: i.material-icons card_travel],
                                the selected objects will be placed on the clipboard and the color of the button will
                                change from blue to grey. The gray color of the button means that there are some objects
                                in the buffer. Then you can go to other objects, select a few more and put them in the
                                clipboard in the same way by clicking on
                                #[a.btn-small.btn-floating.waves-effect.waves-light.grey: i.material-icons card_travel].
                                The color will remain grey. The operation of placing objects in the clipboard can be
                                repeated as many times as necessary. In order to display a list of objects from the
                                clipboard, you need to deselect all objects in the Objects system menu and click on
                                the gray button
                                #[a.btn-small.btn-floating.waves-effect.waves-light.grey: i.material -icons card_travel].
                                A list of objects from the clipboard will appear in the Objects system menu, and the
                                #[a.btn-small.btn-floating.waves-effect.waves-light.blue: i.material-icons card_travel]
                                button will turn blue again. The blue color of the button means that the buffer is
                                empty and you can fill it with new objects.

                            h5.

                        Create a task from an action
                    p.
                        Tasks are used to create automation. A task is a set of actions with parameters that will be
                        running in a given sequence. To create a task, you need to set the necessary parameters for
                        an action and add it to the task. Then repeat the operation to add other actions with the set
                        parameters to the task. The result is a task consisting of several actions. A task can be
                        edited using the Task maker action and executed in any of the available ways:
                    ol
                        li Run a task manually
                        li Set the execution time at which the task will automatically run
                        li Assign a condition under which the task will be running
                        li.
                            Using the Counter settings action and the Task runner collector, create a counter that
                            run the task. A counter can depend on another counter and, if specified conditions are met,
                            launch a dependent counter with a task to execute. In this case, dynamically generated
                            parameters can be passed to the task.
                    p.
                        As an example, a task might be updating some application service, consisting of the actions
                        "Update service files", "Apply SQL script to the service database" and
                        "Edit service configuration file". After creating such a task, you can assign a condition
                        for its execution: stop the service. As soon as the service is stopped, the task to update the
                        service will be performed automatically.
                    p.
                        Another example would be to create objects in the system to monitor automatically found hosts
                        on the network. To do this, use the Counter settings action to create a counter that, using
                        the Objects discovery collector, will search for objects on the network. Next, create another
                        dependent counter, which, using the Task runner collector, will launch a previously created
                        task to create the found objects, set the properties of the objects, and connect the necessary
                        counters to them for collecting data.
                    p.
                        You can also create a task that will perform service maintenance. For example, backup,
                        packaging and rotation of logs, database maintenance, and so on. To do this, you can create
                        a task or several tasks that will automatically start actions on some condition, for
                        example, "service stop".

                        Run current action (Ctrl+Enter)
                    p.
                        After all the parameters have been set in the selected action, it is necessary to run the action.
                        To do this, use the action launch button
                        #[a.btn-small.btn-floating.waves-effect.waves-light.red: i.material-icons play_arrow].
                        Changes will only occur after you click the action's launch button. Until then, no changes
                        to the action's parameters will result in real changes that the action performs.
                        During the execution of the action, a window with information about the details of the execution
                        of the action will open. From this information, you can determine that the action was running
                        correctly and no errors occurred during the run of the action.

                    p.
                        You can run an action by pressing the key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Enter&gt;.
                        In this case, the action will be running, and a corresponding notification will be displayed.
                        The window with detailed information about the execution of the action will not open.
                        You can always see the information about the execution of the action by clicking on the
                        #[i.material-icons file_upload] icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

                        The address bar of the browser contains information about the selected objects in the
                        Objects system menu, the selected action in the Actions system menu, and the parameters of the
                        selected action. For information about the state of objects and actions,
                        the parameters u,c,s (for information about objects) and a (for information about an action)
                        are used.
                    p u - list of selected objects

                        (a=%2Factions%2Fobjects_creator). Object17, Object18 and Object19 objects are not selected
                        (u=Object17%2CObject18%2CObject19). Object15 and Object16 selected (c=Object15%2CObject16)

                        In addition to information about the state of the system menu, the address bar of the browser
                        may contain information about the parameters of the current action. The example below displays
                        information about the settings set by the administrator for plotting the Data browser activity.
