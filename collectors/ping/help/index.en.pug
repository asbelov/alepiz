                        Ping is used to check host availability over the network.

                    h3 What is Ping for?
                    p.
                        With Ping, you can organize a host network access check using ICMP. It is also possible to
                        measure parameters such as packet loss percentage and packet round trip time (RTT). IPv4 and
                        IPv6 are supported.
                    p.
                        The collector uses its own implementation of the Ping protocol. In case of packet loss, it
                        additionally runs an external ping program to check the received values.
                    h3 Parameters
                    ul.browser-default
                        li Target host name, IPv4 or IPv6 address (host) - name or IP address of the remote host
                        li.
                            Ping interval is a time between echo requests packets in seconds (pingInterval) -
                            interval between sent packets in seconds
                        li.
                            Size of echo request packet (IP header + ICMP) in bytes from 48 to 4096 (packetSize) -
                            packet size in bytes
                        li.
                            Number of echo requests to send. 0 is infinite (packetsCnt) - number of packets sent.
                            0 - infinitely
                        li.
                            The packet wait timeout in a second, after which packet loss will be detected.
                            Mast be greater then ping interval (timeout) - the timeout in seconds for the packet to
                    h3 Settings
                    p.
                        Collector settings are stored in a file config/conf.json in the section collectors.ping
                    ul.browser-default
                        li.
                            localAddress - The IP address from which the connection to the collector server is made.
                            If null or not specified, then the connection will be made from the IP address that the
                            operating system will select
                        li.
                            serverAddress - IP address that the collector listens to and is connected to
                        li.
                            port - TCP port that the collector listens on
                    h3 Return value
                    p The packet round trip time in milliseconds (RTT), or 0 if the host did not respond.
