                    p.
                        NSLookup used to get IP address from DNS hostname
                    h3 Parameters
                    ul.browser-default
                        li.
                            Host name - DNS hostname to get IP address
                        li.
                            Return errors - if an error occurs, the error text will be returned as the IP address
                        li.
                            Check if the hostname is correct - check hostname against standard
                        li.
                            Get hostnames by IP address - if an IP address is specified as the hostname,
                            DNS names for this IP address will be returned
                    h3 Returned value
                    p.
                        Returns the IP address, hostnames, or 0. If "Return errors" is enabled and an error occurs,
                        the error text will be returned instead of the IP address. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses supported.
                    p.
                        If an IPv4 or IPv6 address is specified in the "Host name" parameter and several DNS names were
                        obtained during the DNS query, the following happens:
                    ul.browser-default
                        li The entire resulting array of values is converted to JSON text and saved to a database with a history of values
                        li.
                            If the counter has dependent counters, then ALEPIZ will call them as many times as the
                            values are received in the array and each time pass the %:PARENT_VALUE:% new value from
                            the value array as a variable.
