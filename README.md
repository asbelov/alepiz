# ALEPIZ

Management and monitoring system.
ALEPIZ allows you to create complex solution to automatic discovery and monitoring any objects. 
In addition, ALEPIZ can be used as an infrastructure management system.
Modular architecture allows you to add your own monitoring and management components and collectors. 
Due to asynchronous, the system has high performance and lack of locks when objects are unavailable or have a slow response. 
The built-in database and smart cache allows you to use the minimum amount of resources to achieve high performance.
